/**
 * Who may read the ops page.
 *
 * Laravel's own `auth` middleware cannot be used here. It answers an unauthenticated visitor by
 * redirecting to a route named `login`, and a Filament app has no such route — so the page blew
 * up with `Route [login] not defined`, turning a diagnostic screen into a 500 that had nothing to
 * do with the thing being diagnosed.
 *
 * So access is decided here and the answer to a stranger is **404**, never a redirect. There is
 * nowhere sensible to send someone who is not signed in: the page is not a destination they were
 * heading to, and an unauthorised visitor should not learn there is something here at all.
 *
 * Two credentials are accepted, because the page has two kinds of reader:
 *
 * - a **signed-in user**, which is the ordinary case and needs no secret shared around;
 * - the **health token**, which is the only way in when the login system is itself part of what
 *   has broken — and that is the afternoon somebody needs this page most.
