/**
 * The machine endpoint. JSON only, token only, and — the whole point — **no session**.
 *
 * On `SESSION_DRIVER=database` — a common default — a health route inside the `web`
 * middleware group therefore boots a session out of the very database it is being asked about,
 * so the moment that database goes away `StartSession` throws and the monitor gets a 500 with no
 * explanation instead of `database: SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused`. The endpoint would
 * fail exactly when it is needed, and report nothing about the failure it was built to report.
 *
 * So this route carries no middleware at all and the token is the credential. The ops page is a
 * separate route that can afford a session, because a human reading it is not the thing that has
 * to work during the outage.
