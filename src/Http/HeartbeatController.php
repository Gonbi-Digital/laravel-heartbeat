/**
 * The page a human opens when a deploy went wrong.
 *
 * Standalone Blade with inline CSS — no Inertia, no Vite bundle, no layout inheritance. A
 * diagnostic screen that needs the frontend build to render is no use on the deploy that broke
 * the frontend build, and that is the deploy people open it on.
 *
 * It answers JSON to `Accept: application/json` as well, carrying the full report rather than the
 * bare contract. A monitor should point at `/health` instead, which has no session middleware in
 * front of it; this is for the person who is already signed in and wants everything on one screen.
